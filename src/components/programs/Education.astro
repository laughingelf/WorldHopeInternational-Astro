      <strong>Changing Futures Through Christ-Centered Education</strong>

    <p class="p">
      In the villages surrounding Word Hope International’s campus,
      <strong>
        more than 50% of children between the ages of 4 and 18 have never attended a
        single day of school.
      </strong>
      This heartbreaking reality represents not only a lack of education but also a loss
      of potential, opportunity, and hope. Word Hope is committed to changing that.

          Plans are underway to establish a school on the Word Hope campus, a place where
          children left behind by traditional systems will find a new beginning. This school
          will offer access to quality education in a nurturing, Christ-centered environment
          that empowers students to:

        <ul class="ul">
          <li>Discover their God-given purpose and find passion in learning</li>
          <li>
            Unlock their educational potential by nurturing students academically, emotionally,
            socially, and spiritually

          To ensure excellence from the ground up, a team of experienced educators is actively
          overseeing the development of the school. These leaders bring decades of expertise in
          early childhood education, library sciences, and classroom instruction:
